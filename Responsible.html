    <ul>
      The National Responsible Gambling Programme (NRGP) is a resource that integrates research and monitoring, treatment and counselling, public education and awareness, as well as industry training. It is still the only programme of its kind in the world that is jointly controlled by a public/private sector partnership which involves government regulators and the industry.

      The NRGP is managed by the SA Responsible Gambling Foundation (SARGF) which comprises a Board of Directors who represents regulators and the industry. The SARGF reports to the SA Council on Responsible Gambling (SACREG), established by the National Gambling Board and a public/private sector partnership. There is a high degree of accountability and transparency in terms of financial management. Reports on the activities of the programme are published regularly.

      <div class="about_content">
        <h1 class="about_article-title" style="text-align: center;">Treatment and Counselling:</h1>
      <ul>The NRGP’s toll-free Problem Gambling Counselling Line service operates countrywide 24/7and is staffed by up to nine multilingual telephone counsellors. It received 16 192 calls in total during the year, of which 2 891 were problem gambling specific calls and referrals.
    
        The NRGP’s national network of 75 Treatment Professionals provided free and confidential outpatient treatment and counselling services to 1 318 problem gamblers, referred 15 problem gamblers for inpatient treatment, 25 problem gamblers for debt management counselling, and assisted 28 relatives of problem gamblers with family counselling.
        
        The capacity of the Treatment Management Team was greatly improved with the appointment of clinical psychologist Dr Adele Pretorius as the Treatment Director, with effect from September 2010. The team embarked on a partnership with the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cape Town, under the leadership of Professor Dr Dan Stein. Objectives are to   develop capacity for clinical evaluations, diagnosis of problem gamblers with co-morbid conditions (like alcohol or drug addiction) and to provide clinical supervision of treatment professionals and treatment options based on best practices.
        
        Another appointment is psychiatrist Dr Heidi Sinclair, who is the first incumbent of the newly established Fellowship in Pathological Gambling in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cape Town – a first for South Africa and the African continent.
        
        The treatment programme, in its entirety, was reviewed and a number of recommendations were implemented in order to improve quality of the services and the pace of delivery. Professor Graham Barr, who has been central to the preparation of materials for the NRGP’s Handbook on Gambling, has also reviewed the data programme used to capture counselling line statistics in order to implement phased improvements.
